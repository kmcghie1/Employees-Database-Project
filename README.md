This project, essentially, allows users to input .csv files into their desired database application (e.g. MySQL, Postgres) while removing all duplicates.

This project tested my abilities and knowledge of Java concepts. The most prominent of these concepts being OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and its four principles (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism). In addition, S.O.L.I.D and its 5 principles were also applied.

Included is a folder, which contains all of the Java files that I coded onto (including the App/Main file, which is was starts the program).
